# Ponytail Help

Display this reference card when invoked. One-shot, do NOT change mode, write flag files, or persist anything.

## Levels

| Level | Trigger | What change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lite** | `/ponytail lite` | Build what was asked, name the smaller option in one line. |
| **Full** | `/ponytail` | The smallest complete change, a check where the logic needs one, and a reply that names what was skipped and any risk. Default. |
| **Ultra** | `/ponytail ultra` | Also questions the request and pushes back before building. |

Level sticks until changed or session end.

## Skills

| Skill | Trigger | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ponytail** | `/ponytail` | Lazy mode itself: least new code, clear replies that name skipped work and risks. |
| **ponytail-review** | `/ponytail-review` | Quality review of a diff: bugs, security, load, missing tests, speed, what to cut. Each finding says what goes wrong and how to fix it. |
| **ponytail-audit** | `/ponytail-audit` | The same quality review for the whole repo, ranked. |
| **ponytail-debt** | `/ponytail-debt` | Harvest `shortcut:` comments into a tracked ledger. |
| **ponytail-gain** | `/ponytail-gain` | Measured-impact scoreboard: less code, less cost, more speed. |
| **ponytail-help** | `/ponytail-help` | This card. |

In Codex, invoke the repo-local skills with `$ponytail`, `$ponytail-review`, or `$ponytail-help`. Claude Code uses the slash-command forms above.

## Deactivate

Say "stop ponytail" or "normal mode". Resume anytime with `/ponytail`. `/ponytail off` also works.

## Repo installation

All six skills live in `.agents/skills/`; `.claude/skills` links there. This is a repo-local skill installation. Plugin lifecycle hooks, statusline, and automatic updates require a separate host plugin installation.
